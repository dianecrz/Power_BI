This repository is meant to host some of my Power BI dashboards and reports. 

## Files
The folders contain the dataset(in xlsx or csv format) used, the dashboard itself (in pbix), and the dashboard converted into pdf format.

## Challenges (Enterprise DNA)

### 1- Executive Sales Report
You are an analyst working at a major retailer. The sales director has approached you and asked for you to prepare a report that he can take to the executives regarding sales performance and to make sure it looks good. Unfortunately, he is unavailable for any further conversations about what he wants in the report!!

### 2- Customer Insight
You are an analyst working closely with the customer team.

The customer engagement manager (Janet) has just returned from a meeting and has been given two data sets. One contains customer sales information and the other customer engagement information.

Janet is now looking for you to produce a report that looks at both data sets and gives us some insight into customer behaviour.

She is not sure if there is a correlation between sales and engagement but would like to know either way.

There is 1 years worth of data taken from both systems.

The ball is now in your court and you need to find a way presenting this data back to Janet and the team.

### 3- HR Data Insights
News is fast spreading about who the go to analyst is in the company. (PS it’s YOU)

The HR manager (James) has approached you for some help.

He is reviewing all internal consultations that have taken place around policy changes.

They currently have a HR system in place where they create and manage the respective consultations.

The current process is that once management decide that there is going to be a change to any policy, they then create a consultation within this HR system assigning a window to hold interviews with employees.

The company policy is that every employee will be interviewed twice regarding the change. The outcome of each interview is recorded.

Unfortunately the current system doesn’t have a reporting suite.

James has managed to get the data out of the system with some help from IT but isn’t sure where to go next.

He has said he is looking to report back to his seniors around the outcomes of these interviews and what the reception has been towards a consultation. James is also keen to establish the change of outcomes between the two interviews and any other metrics that you feel are key to this report.

The ball is now in your court and you need to find a way presenting this data back to James.
